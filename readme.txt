FTrainer

A Freedom Planet Cheat Engine Trainer designed for speedrunners.
Works for game versions 1.21.5, and supports all 3 available characters.

The executable includes cheat engine and the trainer's extensions, so you don't need them previously installed to run it.
When you open it or use any hotkey, it'll attempt to attach to the game to provide all functionalities.
