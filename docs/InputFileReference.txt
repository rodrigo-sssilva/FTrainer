If the first word doesn't match 0, 1 or first words above, the line will be treated as commentary.

Though not required, setting undesireable values as false is recommended, because it will avoid settings from a previous file from being applied and affect playback.

Inputs:
1 = perform the input
0 or . = don't perform the input
Use the line "pause" to automatically pause a playback.
Use the line "speed n" to automatically change the playback's speed. n must be an integer from 1 to 5, corresponding to the speed changer's list box index. 
Use the line "end" or an empty line to force a playback to end.
Anything else is treated as commentary.
